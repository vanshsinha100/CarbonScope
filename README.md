# Data Visualization Assignment 3 - GHG Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions** using a visual analytics workflow. The analysis covers:
- **Industry-level emissions over time**
- **Commodity-specific emission drivers**
- **Comparison of emission factors across different sectors**

### Technologies Used:
- **Machine Learning**: To enhance data analysis and uncover deeper insights.
- **Clustering Techniques**: To group and analyze industries, commodities, and sectors.
- **Data Visualization**: To present GHG emissions data clearly and effectively.

## File Structure:
- **A3_IMT2022108, A3_IMT2022122, A3_IMT2022097**: Different components or iterations of the analysis.
- **Report Images**: Visuals used in the report.
- **A3_Presentation-GraphGeeks.mp4**: A video presentation summarizing the project.
- **GraphGeeks_DV_Assignment_3-report.pdf**: The final report of the analysis.

## How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure that the required dependencies (machine learning libraries, data visualization tools) are installed.
3. Run the analysis scripts located in the project folders.

## Key Insights:
- **Emission Trends**: Analysis of trends and key contributors across industries.
- **Commodity Impact**: Evaluation of commodities affecting GHG emissions.
- **Sector Comparison**: Comparison of emission factors across sectors.
